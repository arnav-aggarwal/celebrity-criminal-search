He has also been charged with DUIs on multiple occasions.\n\nFamous on-screen warrior Mel Gibson has unfortunately carried his violence offscreen, as he faced misdemeanor spousal battery charges in 2011. Gibson appeared in a Los Angeles courtroom within days of the charges and reportedly said very little, aside from acknowledging the charged crimes and accepting a plea deal. The no contest plea involved no jail time but rather 36 months of probation and a mandatory 52 weeks of domestic violence counseling.[2]Gibson’s partner, Oksana Grigorieva, accused him of striking her during a dispute in early 2010. She did not attend the hearing, preferring to concentrate on “moving forward with her life,” according to her lawyers. The next time Braveheart makes its way to your television, consider the fact that Gibson was officially charged with mimicking this ferocious behavior in real life."

Broderick fractured his ribs and one leg, and had a concussion as well as a collapsed lung. Grey suffered severe whiplash and some other minor injuries. Broderick was charged with causing death by dangerous driving and faced up to five years in prison, but the charges were reduced to carless driving, with a fine of $175. The victim’s family called it a travesty of justice."
